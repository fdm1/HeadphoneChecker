HeadphoneChecker
----------------

My usb-c dongle and usb-c headphones both fail all the time. I'm tired of
having to turn the volume up and hold my phone up to my ear like a jerk to
figure out if it's working or not. This is an android app that will display a
message to the screen whenever this toggles between headphone and speaker usage
so I don't have to do that.

Also, this is my first Android app, so it's a good testing ground for learning
about Android development in general.
